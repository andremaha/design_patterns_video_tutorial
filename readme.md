# Desing Pattern Video Tutorial

Recently I've been asked to perform a regular training session series, where I would teach how to use Symfony2 Framework.

During the first lessons I've started getting questions about sertain way things work in Symfony2. This *things* are not covered in the Symfony2 Documentation, but without the solid understanding of those kinds of architectual desicions behind Symfony2, it's hard to comprehend the more day-to-day business as well. 

The questions that were asked all boiled down to this one: "Why Symfony2 does it *this* way?!". The answers were pretty clear to me, but I found them difficult to explain. 

This magical "things" I was struggling to explain are called Desgin Patterns. 

And this video tutorial series is about them.
